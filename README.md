# ðŸ§® Simple Calculator (C++ OOP)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
A console-based **Simple Calculator** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations with error handling for division by zero.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸ”¢ Input two numbers from the user  
- âž• Addition  
- âž– Subtraction  
- âœ– Multiplication  
- âž— Division (with division-by-zero check)  
- ðŸš« Error handling for invalid operations  

---

## âš™ How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to **enter two numbers**  
2. The user **chooses an operation** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
3. The program **performs the calculation** and displays the result  
4. If division by zero is attempted, it **shows an error message** instead of crashing  

---

## ðŸ›  How to Run
1. Save the code in a file named **`SimpleCalculator.cpp`**
2. Open the terminal/command prompt in the same directory
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ SimpleCalculator.cpp -o calculator

## Example Run
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): *
Result: 50
```

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of compiling and running C++ programs.

## How to Compile & Run
```bash
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```
